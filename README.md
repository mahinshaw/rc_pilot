# RcPilot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mahinshaw/rc_pilot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mahinshaw/rc_pilot)

RcPilot is inspired by Thoughtbot's [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).  Moving dotfiles isn't really that hard, but it would be nice to automate that process, including the source management.  That is the purpose of RcPilot.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rc_pilot'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
